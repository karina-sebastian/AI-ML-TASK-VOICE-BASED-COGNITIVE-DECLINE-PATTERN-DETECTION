            "  Okay, looks good. So if we can just move around a little bit to activate the connect until we see a green skeleton looking thing up there. Let's move around. There it goes. Okay, perfect. So I'm going to go ahead and start up the ritual human that you'll be talking to when it's over when you just go ahead and end ring this bell so I know that it's done. Okay. Well, let me know when I'm done. Yes. Okay. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for having me today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I could raise a friend. I have a judge. I can't. I have a computer. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. How are you doing today? We're doing all right. That's good. Where are you from originally? Originally I'm from California. I'm born in Glendale. Nice. I don't like your living situation. I'm not too happy with it. Why? I'm just unemployed at the moment. But I actually seek in doing what I'm supposed to be doing. There's some prospects there, but hopefully I'll learn something today. It can be talked to find a good job these days. Do you have roommates? Yeah. What is it like for you living with them? Why I want to see girlfriends. I consider a roommate a lover type thing. Oh. I'll see you then. Probably. I'll see you then. More? Pretty close. How do you know them? I met her last year and we've been through some troubling times, but we're starting to see a light at the end of them. That's good. How do you know about that? The troubling times? Yes. Let me see. Well, I got an U.I. last year and lost my job. I'm a truck driver by trade. So that kind of threw me away off having a $1400 a week job and then going to nothing. I was like plus losing my license. I was really threw me off. I couldn't really have any founding that I was interested in. So I started cooking and trying to see which other route I can go as far as having some kind of a career. So I'm choosing to go into the culinary field, but you know, me and my wife still have the work. It's hard to find a word without going to school. But I think today I applied at Rouse. Hopefully I'll get that I should have that job actually. But I'm certainly going to see a light like I said it in a tunnel now. A little by little. What's your dream job? My dream job would be probably forestry service. I'm going to. I like being a mom. How did you decide to do that? Well, you know, I have a lot of love for ammo. I'm an exotic animal trained by trade. So, and I like being I don't like people too much. So being outdoors and I've always enjoyed being outdoors. That's how I like being a truck driver. I've traveled the world. I don't necessarily like being in a warehouse or in office. I'm more of outdoors type of guy. Yeah. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. One of my trips would be I spent a year in half in Japan and on the lower island there that they built that bridge. The largest bridge in the world. I went there to work for an all white tiger act and working for a Japanese circuit. So it was interesting that a lot of people that Ireland hadn't really seen a lot of Americans. But that was one of the islands also that we that they bond. So there was a lot of negativity but I pretty have a good outlook on life, especially during those times. I enjoyed myself, you know, to call the traveling and meet new people and eat different diverse foods. It was a good experience for me. All that whole experience was pretty good for me. You know, traveling around the circuses and you know, it's been great. Nice. What's the thing you really like about a life? Probably want some of the things I like about it. There's not a lot that I like about it. But I like Hollywood. I like the movie industry. The huge different ethnic of people here. I enjoy talking to you a lot of foreigners. I like to see where it came from and what it's like there. Yeah. What are some things that make you really mad? Traffic. Ignorance. Being disrespectful or whatever. Other people being disrespectful towards you or other people. What's the last time that happened? It happens on a daily basis. I write to buzz a lot. Or if I'm writing my bike, people tend to almost from the over sort of not totally paying attention to traffic. I find myself sometimes having to wait to see what they're going to do instead of having to write away or stuff like that. That sucks. Yeah, big time. What do you do when you're annoyed? What do I do when I'm annoyed? I sit there and vent. I speak my mind even though a lot of times it's by myself. I'm just like assholes or whatever. I'm pushing that I carried rocks from my back pockets. If it happens so much where I just amaze me at what people will do sometimes. You almost get run over. I probably almost get run over on a daily basis. If I wouldn't be in the tension I'd be a shit creep. Yeah, how hard is that? It's hard with dealing with people especially trying not to react as there's consequences to your reactions. Yeah. What was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? It was with my girlfriend and it was about being honest. I'm pretty honest with I'm opening an honest about anything and everything. What it was about was just her lines of me telling me that she had told our landlord something. That she had done something in that aspect and I come to find out a week later that it was a total lie. I didn't like that at all. Yeah. How did you feel in that moment? Pardon me? How did you feel in that moment? I'm trying to send the word for it. I just said I don't know now whether I can believe anything she said that. I felt it hurt. Here we've been in a relationship for a little bit. That's probably one of my biggest pieces is being honest. I can say I don't hold back. I'm pretty honest in anything and everything that I do or say. If you're lying about something you will, you're always having to cover more lives with the lives that you already told. I don't see any. It took a lot from me trusting her now or whatever. Is it truthful? Is it not? It's kind of hurt our relationship. I'm sorry to hear that. That's about me. What are some things you would like to do for fun? Fun. I go to the beach. I love shooting darks but I haven't done it in a while. I love the paint. I got it in the watercolor painting and pretty gifted at that. I want to try some other mediums and love fishing. I haven't gone in a while though. I like driving trucks. My job was, I really enjoyed it. I don't like driving to cities but usually when I'm in the middle of the night, I can see all the stars and I like stargazing. I can see if I can pick out some of those astronomy, start up there. I'm a pretty easy-going guy so I'm shooting pool, sunshine, just a lot of light. That's great. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Most memorable experiences. Good or bad? What happens to your mind? Most memorable experiences. Probably playing with lines and tigers, wrestling a baby elephant in a mud puddle. I just enjoy myself. Awesome. I'm sorry to do your family. I don't have much family that is. At least here in the States, I don't have miles from Central America. But I'm not close to, I have three brothers, one sister, and I'm probably not really close to none of my siblings. I speak with one brother quite a bit. My other youngest brother, I just rather not. I can't converge with him, but I try to keep it on a professional basis. My sister, I don't talk to it all. My other brother, underneath me, I haven't spoken to him in years. So I'm just close with my mom, my niece, some of my nephews, and that's about it. Okay. Can you tell me anything to avoid it? Had I done anything to avoid it? Yes. To avoid them? Yes. Yeah, I just don't talk to him. I don't call him. I don't ask about him. I talk to my mom quite a bit, my brother quite a bit, but I just don't bring up those subjects. Or if they are brought up, I just usually say, you know, that's on them, and I really don't want to do it. I don't even know. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's been hard lately. It's been probably hard for the last going on a year. You know, I depend on my thought process at the time. I like to have been looking for work quite a bit. I was just wondering why I don't get called. I just have my raising thought. Or I get depressed, you know, because I worry about things that really I have no control over. So lately I just been sleeping a little bit too much, at least for me, because I was so used to just sleeping 45 hours a night and I was changed to about eight to nine hours, and I'm still tired. Do you feel like we're off in? Oh, lately I haven't. Far about the last few months. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I don't sleep well, I just do all back on the same thing that have been bothering me. I love the work. And if I'm not, then that's just too much time for me to spend in my own head. And so, you know, if I'm busy, I'm doing what I, you know, and whatever job I do, I kind of get into it, I enjoy it. It's something new for me. So I can think about, you know, either work or I can go home and then think about this, you know, I don't have to worry about, you know, money, you know, bills getting paid, and I can just concentrate on other things, either, you know, do the things I like or, you know, maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend or, you know, so, stuff like that. How do you cope with that? How do I what? How do you cope with that? How do I cope with them? I just try not to think about it. It's not about whether it's coping with it or not. I just do. I'm a more of a guy. You know, it may take me a moment to, to save them coping with something, but, you know, if I have no control over it, there's nothing that I can really do about it. The only thing I can do is continue what I'm doing, and that's actively looking for work, actually going out on interviews, talking with others about work, so I can just kind of, you know, give back to basics, you know, I just don't like the laws of bothering me. It does bother me, but I try not to, to let it continue bothering me. Yeah. Has that gotten me in trouble? If what has gotten me in trouble? My mood, I mean... Yeah, money, I mean, you know, my past, I got a past history, so, which kind of tends to bother my hiring process. I don't know if I'm going to get hired, so I'm going to give it different type of employers who are, say, lonely friendly and stuff like that. And I try, you know, I've taken classes on how to interview, how to answer some of the questions, which, you know, come up quite a bit, and I kind of reflect back on that, but I just, I got to keep putting into my head that that's not who I want to be anymore, so, or, you know, I've done, I've done, I've done my time, so to say, but I took the time, you know, the last time I just took a lot of time and, and try to work on the issues that were bothering me, so, you know, towards positive stuff, I got my GDs, and different things, a lot of classes thought about going to school, looking to go into school, and anything that would kind of change my old ways and, and try to move on to more productive activities. That's good. Do you feel like they're busy so? Pardon? Do you feel like they're busy so? I still didn't hear you. Do you feel like they're busy so? That people have been this people? Can you repeat that one more time? Why don't we talk about a week? Pardon? Have you been diagnosed with depression? I've been diagnosed with bipolarism. How hard is that? It's tough if you don't, you know, I don't medicate, so, I mean, I have been on medication before in the past, but, again, as I try to live on life, I try to live life on life's terms, and I just, you know, I know the medical, as step-and-fence, I always want to label something, and what I don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills. You know, I've been on probably a remasable pill, if there is, for that, and, you know, some of them have been too strong, or some not strong enough, and so I just try to cope with things, which is my life skills, you know, I don't want to be using drug-renowned certain drug use work for like three to four months, six months, and then they go, well, here I'm going to try you on this, or I'm going to try you on that, and it's just an ongoing process, and I probably, for about the last two years, actually about three years, I kind of just said, you know what, that's it. And whether it's different than, or if I would be on meds for it, I don't think so, you know, it's still the same stuff, I still get the same problems, and I still get the same anxieties as if I was on medication for it or not, so I just, you know, deal with it, you know, sometimes it's not good, you know, I get irritated at people a lot, I don't like people, I don't like crowds, I don't, you know, like mocked as people, and you then be quiet, so, but I got a, you know, it's not that I'm personality, but I think people can see me, and just say, I don't mess with the sky, you know, but still, you know, I write public transportation quite a bit, and you know, you just get a lot of loud, I'm not just people on there, sometimes I got to get off the bus, that's how I deal with people, because I just know there's consequences, if I didn't deal with it that way, so I just let it go. I'd rather take the time on getting off the bus week, for the next bus, and hopefully it's not that bad. I understand, did you think you had another problem before you found out? Did I have a problem before I got out? Did you think you had another problem before you found out? Well, I don't know if I knew that I had a problem before I found out, the thing is, I know other people, I have a lot of ups and downs, so I know a lot in my younger days, people would tell me, you know, when I told them that I was diagnosed with, you know, bipolar, or that a lot of remarks were like, oh, that's what, you know, that's what was wrong with you, you would have found that out years ago. And like I said, I don't think the meds really work, but what I do, I think time, kind of, you just get older, kind of, you know, makes it work, you know, made you in with life, so. How do you see an answer back to you? Pardon me? How do you see an answer back to you? I talked to a therapist, probably on a weekly basis for a while, recently, and it helps a lot, you know, just to get out my anger, my thoughts, a lot of people, other people may not understand that, but a therapist is, I think the biggest thing is that I can just get it all out, whatever is following it, whether it be people, you know, other issues, you know, whatever the case may be, I just think, talking about it, and that's such good listening, and kind of like, you know, that you begin to see that by that, you know, that I, you know, give myself or whatever that I would give to others, but it's always helpful if you hear it from somebody else, somebody who, both of you, have, you know, are, you know, they go to school for this stuff. But it's good to be here. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? Why don't go anymore? So, I kind of miss it, you know, like I said, I miss it a lot, actually, but I just one of those things, you know, I just deal with it, you know, according to me, you know, if I were going to chance to go to therapy, again, I'd probably go. Why did you stop? Well, monetary reasons, and, you know, I don't have health insurance. There's a lot of things that, you know, I'd like to do, but I can't, you know, money situation is not that great right now. I'm sorry. How does my friends describe you? How does my friends describe me? Yeah. They would probably describe me as an energetic, outgoing person, once I get to know people. I'm not a lot, I laugh a lot. But it would probably tell you that I'm also very serious and, and, hidden person, I don't reveal a lot, you know. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Yeah. Someone who's been a positive influence in my life? Yeah. Someone who's been a positive influence in my life? Probably my boss, one of my bosses, when I first started with exotic animals, he was a role, you know, he was German and, they didn't teach, I don't know what he saw in me, but he taught me a lot about working with exotic animals and, I feel a lot of confidence in me and, and, and, and, also, build confidence in myself. And, sort of let me know that, you know, there's nothing that I really can't accomplish if I put my mind to it, so, you know. That sounds like a great insulation. Yeah, it was. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome. Goodbye. Bye. Yeah, thanks, all. She's like, goodbye. Okay, perfect. So, I'm going to go ahead and shut this down and take your makeup and then we just have a quick post-cute food. \n",

            "  Actually, you want me to sneak back just a little bit. Actually, just so you can see. If you want to just stand up off of the chair. Okay. But I think that you can have a seat. Thank you. Okay. Can I have a minute? If the doorbell is here, I'm sure that you know what I'm talking about. That button. Can I have a minute? Okay. Okay. Hi. I'm Ali. Thanks for coming to me today. I just created something before and stayed. And I'm not a bear person. But I knew a lot about people and people I've been in. I was thinking of actually a bear starting. And you can still be with me. I'm not a bear person. But I knew a lot about people. And you're not a bear. I'm not a bear. I'm not a bear. I was thinking of actually a bear starting. And you can still be with me. Are you going to start doing something? Are you going to start doing something? Yes. Okay. So, are you doing something? I'm doing really good. That's good. Where are you from? I'm from Granalio, California. It's the San Fernando Valley, part of Los Angeles. What's the thing you really like about a bear? I love the weather. I like the diversity in people. I like how you can go to a neighborhood. And it's not just one race or kind of food. I love the beaches. All the activities you could go do. Theme parks. Quarriums. Stuff like that, museums. What are some things you don't really like about a bear? This smog. There's a lot of creepy guys. I'm sitting. I'm sure you can tell when I'm sitting. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you use travel a lot? I've pretty much traveled around LA. I've been cross-country and back three times twice was when I was 17. Wow. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like meeting new people and trying different foods and seeing how other people live. I'd like to give them a big hug. When I was 17, I ran away with my boyfriend to upstate New York to Watertown. It was like a Navy Army kind of town. We had an apartment there or it's not a lot. We sold antique spare living. Awesome. What's one of their most memorable experiences? Getting passes, press passes for the sunset strip music festival through a friend. Getting to meet rock stars and hang out at the private parties. Do you think this is a new song? Do you think this is a new song? Try or outgoing. I'm very outgoing. I love people. Sometimes when I'm feeling times, I turn on the fist to scream saber. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best it's got. What do you do to relax? I go to the gym and work out quite a bit. I find it helps relieve stress and keeps my energy level going. I work out a couple days. I feel a little more tired than normal. It just helps me feel good. I'm pretty good at it. I'm very calm. I've worked a lot of events and jobs where you're dealing with thousands of people a day and people you need to talk to and you have to remain calm. They're the customers so you have to make them feel wanted and good because you're getting paid because the money they're spending. I'm good at resolving consumer conflicts and stuff on the job. When did you start asking about your stuff? I had a drunk friend that was just falling around and yelling and saying rude things to people and I started getting loud, just telling her to stop doing that and that she was embarrassing and what she was saying to people was very mean. I wondered if you're talking to people like that. They might not like it and they could attack you or something or you never know or it is LA. That sucks. What's something you feel guilty about? I really don't feel guilty about anything, decisions I've made in my life. I think I've made really good decisions and I always stick with my moral compass what I'm doing. I grew up in church. I haven't gone in years but I still have those values and the rules, the tongue commandments and stuff in my head. Tell me about a situation that really is really difficult. I had a Slumlord landlord and I wish that I called the proper authorities and followed through on a court case instead of letting him bully me out because it wasn't up to code. What about the hardest decision you ever had? A few years back I was dating a guy and he wanted me to move back to where he was from. After a few months he was coming to LA and going back home. I decided to move there and I had just started. This business I was doing event planning was picking up and I decided to leave there and try to do it there and you know on the East Coast and it didn't work out. It was tough deciding like should I leave LA and make this jump and try something new and experience something new or stay when I was doing. I had a degree in dental assisting. I did that for like a year. I didn't like it and then I was studying communications. I was reading television broadcasting and journalism. I'm doing a van work and I wrote for a magazine a couple years and I'm trying to like get a website going and then have like where I'm controlling my own writing and what's going on instead of writing for someone else. How did you decide to do that? I always wanted to write and was always into the news and music and art growing up. I really like Connie Chang. She was like a Channel 4 newscaster in the 80s and I love Barbara Walters. That's great. I was a nerd. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My sister, she doesn't talk to any of the family and I have a good relationship with my mom. I never really knew my dad. It doesn't bother me. I have cousins and stuff but everyone scattered across the country so I don't really talk to them on phone. We just communicate on Facebook or like Twitter. How easy is it to get in a bed and sleep? I go right to sleep. When I get tired I just go to sleep. How did you do it? Pretty good and energetic. I've been motivated to go look for more van work, you know, and planning stuff and really grinding it more than I was. How hard is van work? It's kind of hard because you got to talk to people and get them to trust you and see that you could plan events and meet people and convince them why they should pay you to do their event and someone else. Do you have any other things that you can do to sleep? No. Tell me about the last thing you felt really happy. I mean I'm generally pretty happy unless something devastating happens. Like someone gets cancer or someone I know dies. I want to say that I'm just super like oh my god happy all the time but it's like an even kill that I feel pretty good all the time. What do you say about the last couple of years? I'm very talkative and friendly and I could approach strangers and talk to their medis and I could adapt to different situations. Even if it's not my scene or a situation or a group of people that I'm used to, I could still jump in, talk to people and be comfortable and make friends and adapt. What are some things you wish you would change about yourself? I want to make more money. Tell me about it. Tell me about it. I remember in like second grade this people used to make fun of me because I was very tall and skinny and I had like straight A's were the highest grades in the class. People would make fun of me and call me giraffe or stuff like that. How are your best friends grade? Very talkative. She would just say that I talked to everyone. And I'm very friendly and if you need help that will help someone you know. Tell me about something you need to do. Oh recently I went up to Oceanside and visited a friend I've known years and we just went out for burgers and hung out on the beach and we got her two year old son and like took him to the park and played. It was really nice and it was cool visiting her. I didn't see her in six months and it was really fun and I want to go again and I like the area. What's something you feel goes with? I guess maybe I could be trying to find my own work more like for my business instead of working for other people. I think I pursue it but I think maybe I could put a little more time a day into it. I don't really know anything like that I want to race or not happen. Okay. Is that what you mean by that? No I feel good about my traces I made and I think I'm on the right path and a lot of things I wanted to do than balls rolling and I'm getting things done. I'm not as big as I want to be but I feel like I'm on my way there. What advice can you give yourself to try for a year's ago? Like 10 years ago I would have told myself to work more in the daytime instead of going out as much as I was. I think I've seen some of this bit of positive influence in my life. My friend we call Mojo. Can you tell me about that? Mojo has a magazine and I just wrote years and he really pushes me to keep writing and keep doing events and keep on the ball I'm rolling. He's one of the biggest people in my life. Tell me you're talented. You could do it. He's just a really good motivation for me. That's great. What do you most probably love about him? Being published I've been on TV shows and just getting my own event thing going. I have a lot of people who read what I write every day and follow him and I just think it's not exactly where I want to be but it's a great start. I work to get to that point. I think I've asked how you do things to share your thoughts. Great. Thanks. Thank you. \n",

            "  Okay, there you are. Wow, let's see yourself this whole time. Okay. So I'm just going to move around so I can activate the connect, which is what's recording your body. Okay. So there we go. Great. Okay. I'm going to start you. When you're finished, when she's done, we'll hit this so that I know that it's going to come. Okay. Thank you. Hi. I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Think of me as a friend. I don't judge. I can. I'm a computer. I'm a computer about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. How are you doing today? Okay. How about yourself? I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from? I'm from a regional. Here in California. Yeah. Where are some things you really like about the life? Well, that is big and broad. It's a lot to do. A lot of job opportunities than other states. Pretty much that is big and it's a lot you can do here. Yeah. Where are some things you don't really like about the life? Traffic. Maybe the violence rate, the bad news, even though you want to know what's going on in your environment, but you still have to watch it so you can look out to see what's going on on the daily basis. What did you study at school? Sociology. I have a two-year degree in liberal arts, but my major was sociology. Nice. Are you still working in art? No, I'm actually an MTA bus operator. What's your dream job? Well, since Metro is study growing, my dream job is to move up in the company and I'm about to actually start some classes for supervisory next week. So because they look to promote within the company, so that's the good thing. It's a lot of opportunities that Metro where you can take classes in their pay for your tuition and things of that nature. What's your dream job? Thanks. How hard is it? Well, it's not actually hard. Right now it's easy if you take advantage of it right now because they look to promote within. So since I'm already working there, that's a good thing. So it's good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible. What do you mean? I'm sorry. Let's come back to that later. Okay. What do you do to your office? Read, take a long walk, hop bath, meditate, just close my eyes sometimes. Okay. How are you at controlling your time? I'm pretty much good because see, by me being a bus operator, you run into circumstances and situations you got to remain calm and still remain professional at the same time. How hard is it? Well, I look at it like it goes with experience. You know, you do something on a continuous basis. Usually you, somewhere down the line, you become good at it. You know, so I look at it like that. So I've been driving for years and dealing with the public. So it's just how you handle circumstances. You know, you treat people like you want to be treated. Is that good? No. I'm pretty good at it. You know, maybe when I were younger, you know, as you get older, you get wiser and you learn different things. And I'm still learning today. Yeah. Here's some of it that's been constantly been going to my... How will I say my family, you know, my kids, you know, even though, you know, I have been having a lot of deaths around me, but that's part of the life experience. You know, you board here, but you got to leave here one day. But my kids will keep me, you know, sane and, you know, I love them and my family. Does that sound like a great situation? Thank you. Do you mind if you do a different thing? No. It's the first thing you got there. You know, setting good examples, you know, because you're the first teacher, you know. And you want to set a positive good example for your kids. And I think that's a good thing and it starts at home. Can you give me an example of that? Well, by you being the first teacher, your kids, you're the one that they see on the daily basis when they wake up. So, whatever's been taught in a home, they look at and learn every day. You know, rather it's at home school. You know, kids have a tendency to do things what they see, you know what I mean? So, you try to keep it positive. You know, you're the first teacher to teach them good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and, you know, different things of that nature. How many of your kids? I have a four and a half year old son. I have a seven year old daughter and I also have a 23 year old. Yeah, I'm about to be, well, my daughter's pregnant. What the boy, she has three little girls, so I have three grandkids and one on the way, which is the boy that's time. Awesome. Yeah, thank you. What's the hardest thing about being a boy? The hardest thing is, well, right now, I'm a single parent, so that makes it hard alone itself, you know? And they can be inexpensive at times, you know? And it depends on the person's situation, you know, whether they have help or a job, you know, things of that nature to help the situation better. But it's hard, you know, but you, I try to, you know, keep a job, you know, keep food in the house, you know, just maintain and support my kids the best way I can. What's one of your most memorable experiences? With my kids or just period. Whatever comes to mind. What's memorable for me is that I'm the only one in my family with a degree. So it's kind of like, yeah, it's kind of even though I'm the baby of 10 kids, you know, and I always kept that in the back of my mind, even though everybody will pretty much my whole family have decent job, but I'm the one with a degree. So I kind of like gave myself a pad on the bed like, you know, you know, I just, that's the only thing I remember in graduating, you know, and my family there to support me. That's so good to hear. Thank you. Happy that I accomplished something, you know, just even though it may not be much, but it was better than just having a high school diploma. And I had, I was working on my bachelor's degree, but I ended up in a bad car accident. I never went back. I got distracted and, you know, I was working at the same time, but I was just like more so I needed income than, then schooling at that time. Because I was a young parent, you know, because I had my daughter at 17. So I was like, I needed the money to support her, but I never went back, but I feel like it's never too late. So I felt like I'd take some classes now that I'm with Metro to help me move up the ladder. So that's why I'm starting my class next week. Does that have a great situation? Thank you. What advice would you give yourself at 10 or 12 years ago? Well, the advice over the game myself, that I probably wouldn't have been a young mother at a young age, in that I probably wouldn't stay in school, you know, not let the accident just distract me and not. I would have remained in school. I probably wouldn't have kids early, you know, whether I'll probably go to state in school and probably have a part-time job or something. I just felt like education is an excellent thing for a person. Just having knowledge and learning different things. Keep your mind open to learning new ideas every day. So I think that's the plus, you know, in anybody's shoes, just the better they sell, you know, through education maybe to, maybe promote within your company or whatever the case may be, to help better your career. Yeah. Do you have done anything to avoid it? I'm quite sure. You learn from your mistakes, you know, but at the same time you don't continue to make the same ones. I feel like it's okay to make a mistake, but long as you do something to change, you know, like myself, even though I'm going to school late, but still, I'm going, you know, I want to better myself career-wise. Yeah. There are always trials in my life. Yes. What was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? My oldest daughter, we had a argument because just the life she's living right now and the things that she's going through. And I had told her that she just needs to make some changes to better her situation. And we got into an argument because, you know, how your kids sometimes don't want to hear it, you know, hear the stuff that you're saying, even though it's true or, or they just, you know, quote, they just don't want to hear it. You know, they may be going through something they don't want to hear, but we got to tell her you're not about it, but that just happened, you know. I just told her my, I'm sorry. I'm close to you. Very close. Very close. It's just that the situation, my daughter is in right now, she just needs to make some changes to better her life. And I've been telling her. She's, she kind of like stubborn in her own way. You know, I was raised to listen to your mom. You know, your mom was not going to tell you nothing wrong. And I've been telling her over the years, you know, different things. It's kind of like I was talking to a wall because she did the opposite. And now she's, she regretting it, you know, because she's like, my mom told me this, you know, why am I doing the opposite? So I guess she got a bumper head a couple of times to get it. It's kind of like I didn't told you, I didn't let it alone. And now it's up to you to make the change. Yeah. How hard is the month? It's very frustrating because it's like I'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me. And I'm like, it seemed like it's taken forever for her to change, but it's left up to the individual when they're ready. You know what I mean? Once a person gets tired of something, they make a change. It may not be when you want it to happen, but the ball isn't her court, you know? I only can do so much. Oh, easy. Oh, wow. I have my days. Since I have two little ones, I kind of like trained them to go to bed at 8 o'clock because, you know, they got to go to school. And I think it's important to have a good night's rest because it kind of like, it kind of like, get you ready for the next day or, you know, how you're going to feel if you rest it. With type of person going to be that day, you know, because everybody has their days, you know, rather than good or bad, but that's part of life. And I feel like if you had a good night's rest, hopefully you have a good day, you know? Pretty much, you know, I need my rest because I'm out there driving at bus and dealing with all these people. You know, the job itself is very stressful, so I feel like if I'm rested, it'll help me. What do you like when you do a sleep walk? What am I like? Irritated, tired, lazy, you know? I feel like I won't lay down, probably go to sleep and get the rest that I need, but... What do you do when you're annoyed? You never thought about that. I just, you know, because like I said, you know, everybody had a mom as they do. I never thought about that. Hmm. Okay. Have you ever served in military? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Okay. How do your best friends grow? I don't really have a best friend, but a person that I deal with that I used to work with, she'll probably tell you that I'm very outgoing, a go-getter, dependable, responsible. I'm a people person. I get along with others, you know? I'm kind of like... I live a good mark. Rather, I know you're not. If you were to, you know, like, like you and I now, you know, I, um, you probably say, oh, she seems like a nice young lady or whatever, you know, something like that. That's great. Yeah. When was the last time you were all really happy? Well, I try to stay happy. I'd rather be happy than sad. My kids keep me going, you know what I mean? Especially when I go to pick a month from school or maybe, hey mom, you know, that's just kind of like, make my day. Just them run up to me, you know, and be happy and excited, you know what I mean? Yeah. That's so good to hear. Thank you. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to say. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You more than welcome. You have a good day. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Okay. You're welcome. I'm going to turn on the software then we can just have a video for a second. Okay. That is so interesting. \n",

            "  Then you say, okay, I want to do this, but you end up doing something else. So I didn't think when I was acting, I would ever get into the world of sport. But one day I found an opportunity and I decided I wanted to do it. It was not the easiest, but it was a lot of fun. I worked 18 hour days. And eventually when I look back and I think if it isn't tough, if there isn't a challenge for you in life, then it's not that exciting. You know, and things just fall easily into your lap. I guess you don't appreciate them. So it's been a bit of an uphill journey, but it's been a fun journey. Well, since you've mentioned spontaneity, I want us to rewind and I'd really like you to just briefly tell us how you got into acting because I think that was a really, really cool story. Okay. Okay. So I was studying criminal psychology and my best friend's, boy friend, went to audition for a movie. We were both very poor at that time, so we decided we'll share a cab. Whoever finishes first would pick the other person up. So my exam got over. I took my paper and I finished, so I went to pick him up and there was this major audition happening out there. I of course was always hungry at that time. So since I didn't know what to do, I went to the corner and I started eating and I saw the director out there and he just looked at me and he was like, so what are you going to do for me today? And I was like, nothing. And he was like, all right, I said, no, I'm sorry, I haven't come here to audition. I've just come here to pick up my friend. \n",

            "  Okay. Thank you. Okay, thanks. Thanks. Thanks. I'm gonna go ahead and move this cord behind you just so it doesn't get any way. Thanks. Thanks. Hi. Hello. Thanks for coming today. I just created to talk to people in state and security in Miami. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and they love to learn about you. I'm a therapist, if you're a professor, and that's something I want to learn. Your intents are really common. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, are you doing today? Okay, not too bad. That's good. Where are you from? I'm from Chicago, South Sin. What's your name? Back in 1978 when I was 18. That's what you want, right? I don't know if you know that. Lately, not much, maybe once every two or three years. How does it compare to a life? It's totally different, you know, horrible weather and, yeah, it's just a whole different atmosphere. Why do you look so like? Let's see. My mother had moved to Africa. I graduated from high school, and I had a friend out here, so I just thought, well, let me try LA. Okay. How easy is it for you that you still live in LA? Very easy, actually. I loved it from the moment I got off the airplane. What are some things you really like about LA? Number one, the weather. Sun is very important to me, so I love the weather. I don't know. I kind of have more laid back atmosphere, variety of people. And now it's my home base, you know, my friends that are family. So it's kind of like my family is here now. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I guess the small earthquakes, traffic, just basic things like that, really. Yeah. I'm sure you can tell when I choose, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I don't currently, but I did throughout my life. I travel quite a lot. What are you doing there traveling? Just seeing other cultures and seeing more history and meeting people and just fun, the fun of it as well. And let's see, let's see. Well, one trip, I went to England, Ireland, and Scotland, and France, all in one trip. So that was a nice variety. Nice. What's one of your best moments in the world? I guess you could say probably skiing and valediceire France. That was fun. I'm glad I got to do that. That's great. Do you think this is yourself, or shy, or outgoing? I'm kind of shy by nature. I've tried to grow out of being shy. So I'm not fully shy, but I was always an extremely shy child. But now here in Culver City, this is my environment. And I guess you could say I'm not really shy in my hometown of Culver City. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish to make a screen favorite. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best-aid guy. What do you do to relax? To relax, I like to just curl up in my bed and read my book, take a nap, watch TV, sometimes on the couch in the living room. Just stay at home and kind of vegetate. How are you comfortable in your comfort? Pretty good. Yeah, my temper is pretty level. When was the last time you argued with someone and what did it go? Hmm. Probably with my husband. And I can't remember at the moment what it was about. OK. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, when you say my family, do you mean my family from childhood or my current family? What other things do you like? OK. Well, I guess my current family comes to mind. I have two daughters. And my relationship's pretty good. It's OK with them, but they're teenagers, which, you know, they're going through a lot of hormones. And they can be kind of bitchy. And but I have hope that, you know, they'll grow out of that. And someday we'll have a really good relationship. And then there's the husband, which I guess I could say soon to be ex-husband, hopefully soon. We need to get a divorce, but we're still together due to financial reasons. And yeah, yeah, so that's not good. The relationship with the husband. But since we have determined that we need to divorce, we don't expect anything out of each other so we don't argue as much. So that's good. How do you value situation that you wish you would have with your family? Well, I guess our marriage, I wish I'd noticed early on that, you know, it was like way off from what I thought it was. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to be. Let's see. Oh my god. Hardest decision. I guess leaving my first husband, that was pretty hard. Can you tell me about that? Well, you know, we were married and I wasn't content, I guess you could say. And I kind of just gave up on our relationship. And now that I look back, I think it's because I wanted children. And he would have been happy to never have any. And so since I didn't have a father, it was very important that I create children with someone who really wanted to be a father. And so I was kind of at an age where I needed to start thinking about having children. Yet I was with someone who really was not into it. So I think that's one, maybe the core reason why I was not content and I just felt like this marriage isn't going to work. So we went to therapy and everything. And he did not want to break up. And I had to leave him because I just wasn't happy. And that was very hard because I felt like I was hurting him, which I was. He survived. He got over it. Now he's married with two kids. But it was hard to leave him. Something I wish I could erase from my memory. I have to think about that. I'm sure there's something. Well, yeah, there's, I guess, it'd be nice to erase from my memory a recent, I'm not recent, but an event in my recent adulthood here in Culver City, where one of my best friends, I've betrayed me back years ago when my husband first got into real estate. She and her family were growing and they really needed a larger home. And we just assumed that they would use my husband as their agent, both to sell their current home, current at the time. And to purchase a new home. And as it turned out, they surprised us and had been talking to this other local agent. And yeah, that was devastating. I don't think I'd ever been betrayed like that. So I wish I could erase that. Because now, you know, this was back when the kids were really young. And my daughter at the time, my youngest daughter was, let's say, six, maybe, maybe five. Anyway, her and my best friends daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other. We were pregnant together. And they were really tight, those two little girls. And they ended up not going to the same elementary school. So they didn't get to hang out during those years. But every time we'd run into them in the neighborhood or they'd run into each other at a summer camp or something, they were just so connected. They were just, you know, like two peas in a pod, even though their moms weren't talking to each other anymore. So now they're 13 and 14 and they're in middle school together. And they're still very connected. In fact, she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter and another girl. And it's just a little awkward, you know, because now these girls are becoming really good friends, better friends. And yet I still have this vivid, bad memory of what her, you know, was. Her mom did to me. That was about what? 10, about eight years ago. Anyway. I tried it, I tried it, ignore it and put it out of my head, which I've been able to in recent years. But obviously it still comes up. Anyway, that was that. Not that easy. I do sometimes get a decent night's sleep, but sometimes it's hard to get to sleep and most of the time I wake up and can't get back to sleep. Or I finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up, you know, that difficult thing. Well, the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom. And then, you know, it's not always that easy to get back to sleep and then I wake up again to go to the bathroom. So I guess that's the trigger. As far as getting too sleep, having a hard time there, I don't know, I think there's just too much on my mind running through my mind in the day and I feel like I haven't accomplished enough during the day. So it's hard for me to just go to sleep when I'm supposed to, I guess. Well, I'm kind of used to it now. So I'd just go on through the day, probably looking tired and I'm kind of used to feeling tired. I just do what I need to do. And sometimes if I'm able to, if I'm at home and don't have huge commitments, yeah, I might just, like I said earlier, just take a nap or something. Read my book, watch TV, whatever. And lately, how have I been feeling kind of down on myself, down on life? Well I have this pending need for separation slash divorce. I've worried that I made a lot of mistakes with my girls. Now they're teenagers, you know, on the verge of adulthood. And so I worry that, you know, I did all kinds of things wrong with their guidance and their early childhood. And now it's too late. I miss that a lot of things. And yeah, I need a job. I'm unemployed. I don't know what I want to do with my life. I know I want to do something. I just wish, you know, I never did finish college, unfortunately, because I was traveling and stuff. So I regret that extremely. And I need to get a job and be able to take care of myself because I need to divorce and move on with my life. So now I forget what the original question was, but that's the state, part of the state of my life. Okay. How do you like to invite guys with these guys? No. How do you like to invite those guys with these questions? Yes. How long have you been on that? Well, the first time or recently. The first time I guess was, you know, when I was in my early 20s, I was just a little upset about coincidentally. That was another breakup I had to make back then. I was in my early 20s and I needed to break up with my boyfriend. But again, it was very upsetting because I, you know, it was hard because he didn't want to break up and I felt like I was hurting him. And I didn't understand this feeling. I was really upset. I didn't, that was my first time having depression. So I didn't really recognize it as depression. But I went, somehow I had the knowledge or the, I was able to take myself to a psychiatrist. I remember I paid for her by the hour and she prescribed Xanax to just help relax me. And so I guess that helped me get through that. And then I've had depression throughout the years, just, you know, little bits here and there for various reasons such as, I guess, it's usually a relationship, you know. Yeah, so the most recent time I was diagnosed and put on meds. That was probably about two years ago. You still going to get it now? No. Why did you stop? Money. I don't have insurance. Otherwise, yeah, I'd be happy to go to therapy. Anything that might help. How many of us have you felt really happy? Oh, boy. Last time I felt really happy. I don't know, I guess maybe when my children were born. That's... I guess happy, I don't know. I just, you know, I always wanted children, so it was nice to have them. That's... I don't know, that's all I can remember of that. I guess I don't remember the good times too well. I remember the bad times. Yeah. Something that you really enjoyed. Hmm. Something I did that I really enjoyed. \n",

            "  Yeah, there's all sorts of differences. I'm gonna go along in this building. It's here in my Craigslist, so that's why. Oh, yeah, there's a couple groups of these stakes. Alright, perfect. So this is the show I'm here with. Can I try it? Quite interesting. We can get started. Alright. Hi, I'm Ali. Thanks for coming in today. Thanks for creating a toxic people in the safe and secure environment. Think of me as a friend. I don't judge. I can't. I'm a computer. Okay. We don't learn about people and we'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions today to start it. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. How are you doing today? I'm doing good. Thank you. What's good? We're from Los Angeles. I'm from Los Angeles. You too. Oh, great. Where do you live? I live in West Los Angeles, the West Side. Nice. How do you like your living situation? It's alright. I live alone. No, I live alone. That's great. How do you like the living? I love it. I'm from here. So I grew up here. It's natural. Yeah. Where's the things you really like about my life? The weather. All the weather. It's always good. It's never bad. There's always something to do. It's rarely dull moment. Where are some things you know what I like about my life? The traffic. The traffic is horrible. Well, probably traffic is horrible in almost any major city. But I hate the traffic. Do you travel a lot? Not really. I mean, I have enough things going on here. So if I travel, it's usually somewhere within driving distance. Okay. What did you study at school? I studied business. I didn't. You still didn't know? No, I've been done for a few years. So I haven't gone to school for a while. One of these days I'll go back to graduate school. Awesome. What's your dream job? A dream job would be to just work for myself and make lots of money. I don't really have a dream job. It's just something that I can work under my own terms and get paid decently and be in a creative environment. How hard is life? I don't know. I think it's just a matter of finding the right situation. Right now people are a little conservative about what they want and how they want it. It's a little tougher than it should be. I think when the situation is right, I don't think it's too difficult. It can be tough if I'm going to job in things. I work as an administrative assistant through a temp agency. It just basically gets sent out to do desk jobs. Are you happy with your day job? Yes and no. I feel like I could do more. But no, it works. A close are you to your family? I'm pretty close. I mean, they're around. Where are some things that make you really mad? I'm really mad. Stupid people just basically doing anything to annoy me. That's the big thing. Just irritating stupid people. Just to provoke me for no reason at all. Can you give me an example of that? What's a good example? Just random people who think it's funny to just get a rise out of me. It doesn't have to be one any specific situation. It's just people who just think it's funny. They're just generally sadistic and they just think it's funny to just prod you. It's like poking a stick at an angry dog, knowing that they know how to... They just want to push your buttons for no reason. What is the last one you're talking about? God. I don't remember. With those situations, I usually try not to remember when it happens. I just let it go and just like the past is the past. I just tend not to look back. Do you consider yourself an angelic? What do you mean? What do you do to relax? What do I do to relax? I like to run. I like to go to the gym, listen to music. I have a lot of musician friends. I'm usually around musicians. Anything in that sort, I like everything from punk rock art to tattoos. Anything that's generally art and creative. Awesome. Who's been a positive influence? Who's been a positive? I think it's just friends in general who seem to do well. I think they're very inspiring, which is sometimes a bit tough in a town like Los Angeles where I think everybody's on the go trying to accomplish their own goals. It's sometimes hard to find someone who's going to be uplifting or trying to be inspiring. I don't really have anybody in particular, but people have kind of brought up things here and there. What's life? It's like, hey, instead of doing this, how about doing that or, hey, you're good at this. Why aren't you doing that or something like that? I'm always looking for new opportunities, so they always point out things that maybe I could do differently. Instead of just being negative saying, hey, don't do that. That's why you're doing that. That's a waste of time. That's it. How are you controlling your tongue? I guess it depends on who you talk to. I'm okay at it. I could probably work at that. I don't know. I think I could do better at it. Can you give me an example of that? Well, back to the point about people provoking me. I mean, I try not to blow a steam and let them get under my skin, so I just usually try not to let it get to me. But I don't know. I guess with temper, I guess it depends on how I handle my stress. Lately, I've been better at it just because I think my situation's been a little bit better. What's that? Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you ever served in the military? No. Is there anything you're about to do? Nothing major. Maybe when I was younger, I could have traveled more or I could have worked towards something that paid better job-wise. But those are all things that I think at any point in life you always think like, well, I could have should have done it, but then again, I think that's natural for anybody. I could have become a banker or a lawyer or a doctor who made about ten times the money that I've made now, but then again, I don't like law and I don't like medicine, so it wasn't meant to be. There are always drugs in my life, aren't there? Yeah. What do you decide to do now? I think in my life I knew that there's more dislikes than likes, so I narrowed it down to, what am I good at and what am I not good at and what am I going to work well, who am I going to work well with and who I not work well with, so I kind of sorted out and then the list kind of answered itself. No, I don't think it was hard, but I think it was a real reality check. And I think it's kind of a good thing because sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense. It's like trying to shove a round peg into a square hole, and it's like, it's just no matter how you try to shove it in, it's not going to go in, so sometimes it just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Memorable experiences. I think it's just, I don't really have like any one in particular, I think, I think every day is almost like a memorable experience, whether it's positive or negative. I think it's just everything from getting it, just the fact that I got a job and I can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience, maybe for the average person, it sounds stupid, but you know, I think just the fact that I'm able to get this far in life without like completely self-destructing is already in accomplishments, so I feel like I've gotten somewhere, maybe not to the point to the average person, they might think like, well, why aren't you a millionaire, but you know what, not everybody can be a millionaire. When was the last time you were all really happy? I don't know, I'm not really someone who's like, I don't have any real high highs or low lows, I mean I haven't hit any lows, I mean, I don't know, I'm usually pretty, I feel like I'm a level person and I'm pretty, every day I feel like if I accomplish one thing that I'm pretty happy, I guess to answer the question probably yesterday, I just feel like if I'm able to accomplish something, then hey, I'm happy. I don't know, I don't really have a best friend, but I mean, I'll answer the question generally friends, I think they would say that I'm pretty outgoing, I'm pretty determined, I'm trying, I try to interact as much as possible, I'm always out networking as much as possible, so I don't know, I guess that's basically what I think they would describe me as. Okay. No problem. Alright, bye. You all done? Yeah. Okay, that was weird. Should I unplug this? \n",
